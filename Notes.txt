Notes and Assumptions:

The overall description provides a guideline as to how to break down the design.

A Tank - Which is the container in which the simulation is run

Creatures - (Fish or Snails) that occupy the Tank and interact.

A Tank has many Creatures.

A Creature is a generalized Fish or Snail

A Fish is a generalized Clockwork, Piranha, Sun or Diver fish.

This suggests the class diagram (see rough diagram in simulation.pdf)

From the description we can give the Class Objects the following attributes.

Tank
----

Attributes explicitly mention in the description
  * has-a number of Creatures
  * has-a quantity of food
  * has-a temperature

Attributes implied
  * has-a quantity of oxygen
  * has-a width
  * has-a breadth
  * has-a depth (for this purpose the depth can be considered the depth of the water)

Creature
--------

Attributes explicitly mentioned in the description
  * has-a depth (current depth)
  * has-a eats (array of things it eats)
  * has-a oxygen_hr (amount of oxygen consumed per hour)
  * has-a min_temperature (minimum temperature at which it will survive)
  * has-a status (alive or dead)

Attributes that can be implied from the description
  * has-a min_depth
  * has-a max_depth
  * has-a hunger
  * has-a food_hr
  * has-a age
  * has-a life_expentancy

Note: Attributes that are implied may or may not be implemented in this simulation.


Snail
-----

Inherits from Creature.

Fish
----

Inherits from Creature

Clockwork, Piranha, Sun, Diver (fish)
-------------------------------------

Inherits from Fish

Notes on implementation
-----------------------

We will run the simplation in 'pseudo real time' so that at each tick of the clock
each object in the simulation will be processed for the amount of time since the
previous tick. 

User input

The user interface will be a simple command line program, A single command can be input
with minimum error checking. Attributes of the tank can be modified, creatures can be
added and the current status of the tank and contents can be interrogated.

For further details of the input/output see bin/run.pl help text.
