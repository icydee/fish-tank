Notes and Assumptions:

The overall description provides a guideline as to how to break down the design.

A Tank - Which is the container in which the simulation is run

Creatures - (Fish or Snails) that occupy the Tank and interact.

A Tank has many Creatures.

A Creature is a generalized Fish or Snail

A Fish is a generalized Clockwork, Pyrahna, Sun or Diver fish.

This suggests the following initial class diagram (attached)

From the description we can give the Class Objects the following attributes.

Tank
----

Attributes explicitly mention in the description
  * has-a number of Creatures
  * has-a quantity of food
  * has-a temperature

Attributes implied
  * has-a quantity of oxygen
  * has-a width
  * has-a breadth
  * has-a depth (for this purpose the depth can be considered the depth of the water)

Creature
--------

Attributes explicitly mentioned in the description
  * has-a current_depth
  * has-a food_type
  * has-a oxygen_requirement
  * has-a min_temperature_requirement

Attributes that can be implied from the description
  * has-a life_expectancy
  * has-a hunger
  * has-a age

Attributes that are implied may or may not be implemented in this simulation.
